# Smart-Door


A smart door that uses a machine learning model based off of Google Teachable Machine to open and close for authorized users only. The project uses a 4GB Raspberry Pi 4, NEMA 17 Stepper Motor, Raspberry Pi V2 Camera, and a DRV8825 Stepper Motor Driver Chip. All structural components were printed in house and it uses a pinion and rack movement system. Our demonstration model differentiated between plushies of different "pets", and it allowed access for our pet based on training images we fed the model.
